## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:upgradejs/depngn.git
cd depngn
npm install
```

To be able to test running the CLI manually:

```bash
npm run build
npm link
depngn --help
```

## How it works

The standalone `depngn` package essentially does 4 things:

- determines a user's package manager by looking in the CWD for a lock file (`package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock`)
- reads a user's top-level dependencies from `package.json` (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`)
- reads each dependency's `engines.node` field (if present) from either `package-lock.json` (`npm`) or traversing `node_modules` and reading each dependency's `package.json` (`yarn`)
- determines whether the Node version in question is supported by each dependency

If run with the CLI, you can receive your data in the following formats:
- table (printed to the console)
- json (written to the CWD)
- html (written to the CWD)

The project is split into two directories -- `depngn`, where the modules for reading and parsing dependency information live. And `cli`, where the functionality of the CLI lives.

## Tests

Tests live in the aptly named `tests` directory (which is split into `unit` and `integration` directories). Some tests require reading from the filesystem and so we've added some mock directories with/without expected files so we can test functions. Inside `tests/depngn` you'll see some directories that contain a `mocks` directory with `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, or `yarn.lock` files that are set up for specific test cases. If you are adding tests for `getDepdencies` or `getEngines`, you may need to add a new directory inside `mocks` and use `process.chdir` to make sure the function is being executed inside it.

```typescript
const passingCaseDir = 'tests/depngn/path/to/test/dir';
const failingCaseDir = 'tests/depngn/path/to/test/dir';

// save original cwd
const originalCwd = process.cwd();

describe('the function', () => {
  afterAll(() => {
    // make sure you return to original cwd after tests run
    process.chdir(path.resolve(originalCwd));
  });

  it('does the thing i want', () => {
    // change to relevent directory
    process.chdir(path.resolve(originalCwd, passingCaseDir));
    // run tests and assert stuff
  });

   it('does not do the thing i want', () => {
    // change to relevent directory
    process.chdir(path.resolve(originalCwd, failingCaseDir));
    // run tests and assert stuff
  });
});
```
